Build a full-stack cute pastel wardrobe management website with these features:

👚 1. Authentication

Login + Signup (email + password)

Store users locally (SQLite or JSON)

Redirect to dashboard after login

🧵 2. Add Individual Clothing Pieces

Users can add single clothing items with:

1 image per item (store locally in /static/pieces/)

Name

Category (Top, Bottom, Shoes, Accessories, Jacket, etc.)

Color

Season (Summer, Winter, Fall, Spring)

Optional tags (kawaii, casual, formal, comfy, etc.)

These individual pieces will later be used to build full outfits.

👗 3. Create Outfits From Pieces

Users should be able to:

Select multiple clothing pieces (tops + bottoms + shoes + accessories)

Give the outfit a name

Upload an optional outfit cover image
(or auto-generate using thumbnails of pieces)

Save the outfit to database (/static/outfits/)

Use a drag-and-drop or multi-select cute UI to choose pieces.

📅 4. Daily Outfit Tracking

Users can:

Mark which outfit they wore today

Add optional location

Log automatically stores:

Date

Outfit ID

Automatically update worn count + last worn timestamp

📊 5. Smart Analytics & Suggestions

System should calculate:

For Each Clothing Piece:

How many outfits it is part of

How many times it was worn (through outfit usage)

For Each Outfit:

How many times worn

Last worn date

Smart Suggestions:

Recommend outfits not worn in the longest time

Filter suggestions based on current season

Highlight unused clothing pieces that have never been worn

🎀 6. Cute Pastel Aesthetic UI (Very Important!)

Use a kawaii, soft, pastel theme:

Colors:

Pastel pink

Lavender

Mint

Baby blue

Cream/white

UI Style:

Rounded corners (16–24px)

Soft shadows

Cards with pastel borders

Hover animations (gentle scale + glow)

Cute icons (stars, bows, sparkles, hearts)

Soft fonts like:

Poppins

Quicksand

Nunito

Comfortaa

Pages must feel like a Pinterest x Hello Kitty closet.
